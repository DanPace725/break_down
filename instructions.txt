Build a web app that takes a user input task, sends it to the OpenAI API, and returns a list of simple steps
1. On the front-end, create a user input box using HTML and JavaScript to allow the user to enter their task.
2. Use React as your front-end library to handle the HTTP request to your back-end server.
3. Use Node.js as your server-side programming language to handle the HTTP request and use the OpenAI API to break down the task into simple steps.
4. Use Supabase as your database to store user data and authenticate users.
5. Use Vercel to host your web app and deploy your Node.js code and React front-end.
