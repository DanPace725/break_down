The AI_start directory contains the following files and technologies:

1. App.js: A React component that renders a form for users to submit a task. It uses the useState hook to manage the task state and a handleSubmit function to send a POST request to the '/api/task' endpoint with the task data.

2. index.js: A React component that renders the App component and mounts it to the DOM using ReactDOM.render. It also imports the necessary React and ReactDOM libraries.

3. server.js: An Express server that listens on a specified port and uses the body-parser middleware to parse incoming requests. It imports the openai and supabase modules to handle tasks and user data. The server has a POST route for the '/api/task' endpoint, which processes the task, interacts with the openai and supabase modules, and sends a JSON response.

4. supabase.js: A JavaScript module that imports the createClient function from the Supabase library and defines two async functions, getUser and addTask. These functions interact with the Supabase database to retrieve user objects and insert task objects into the 'tasks' table.

Technologies used in the AI_start directory include:

- React for building the user interface components
- useState hook for managing component state
- ReactDOM for rendering the components to the DOM
- Express for setting up the server and handling API routes
- body-parser middleware for parsing incoming requests
- openai module for processing tasks
- Supabase for handling user authentication and database operations
